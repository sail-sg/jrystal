# Task 4 Log: Align Energy Correction Calculation (GPAW PP)

## Task Completion: 2025-01-04

### Final Status: COMPLETED ✓
All PAW quantities successfully aligned between jrystal and GPAW implementations with differences at machine precision (~1e-14 to 1e-16).

## Implementation Summary

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **GPAW Storage Conventions**:
   - Wave functions stored as φ(r)*√(4π) (without r factor)
   - Core densities stored as n(r)*√(4π)
   - Projectors stored as p(r)*√(4π)
   - Need to handle r factors carefully when converting

2. **Angular Momentum Handling**:
   - GPAW uses `lmax = lcut` (not `2*lcut` as initially assumed)
   - T_Lqp Gaunt coefficients couple projector pairs with spherical harmonics
   - Delta_pL dimensions depend on (lmax+1)² for L index

3. **Debugging Approach**:
   - Compare intermediate values, not just final results
   - Check array shapes at each step
   - Verify storage conventions match between implementations
   - Test with both QE and GPAW files to identify pattern differences

## Files Modified

1. `calc_paw.py`:
   - Added `setup_gpaw()` function for GPAW PP file loading
   - Fixed Delta0 calculation formula
   - Corrected M calculation to match GPAW
   - Properly calculated Delta_lq following GPAW's approach

2. `align.py`:
   - Already had GPAW type handling in `run_gpaw()`
   - No additional modifications needed

3. `md/paw_pp_file_documentation.md`:
   - Added comprehensive Section 3.3 on angular momentum quantities
   - Documented all l-related indices and their relationships

## Testing

- Verified alignment with `python align.py` using `_type = "gpaw"`
- All quantities match to machine precision
- Cross-checked with QE implementation to ensure no regression

## Next Steps

Task 4 is now complete with perfect alignment achieved between jrystal and GPAW for processing GPAW PP files.
