# Task 1 Log: Implement Test File for GPAW PP File

## Status: In Progress

### [Timestamp: Start of Task]
- Created task description file: `task1_gpaw_pp_test.md`
- Waiting for human manager to provide task description
- Created this log file to track progress

### [Timestamp: Task Description Received]
- Task description provided by human manager
- Requirements: Create test file following test_qe_pp_file.py style
- Use gpaw_load.py to load C.PBE.gz from pseudopotential folder
- Create tests for PAW properties based on documentation

### [Timestamp: Analysis Phase]
- Examined test_qe_pp_file.py for style reference
- Reviewed gpaw_load.py for GPAW PP loading functions
- Found C.PBE.gz exists in pseudopotential/ folder
- Reviewed paw_pp_file_documentation.md for test requirements

### [Timestamp: Implementation Phase]
- Created test_gpaw_pp_file.py with 10 test functions
- Encountered encoding issue, resolved by recreating file
- Test results: 2 passed, 8 failed
  
### Issues Found:
1. **Integration tests failing**: Core and valence density integrations off by factor of ~4
   - Likely missing 4π factor in integration
2. **KeyError 'partial_waves'**: GPAW loader returns different key name
   - Need to check actual key names in loaded data
3. **Energy consistency**: Small precision error (1e-7 vs 1e-10)

### Next Steps
- Debug integration formulas - check if 4π factor is needed
- Fix key name issues for partial_waves
- Adjust energy consistency tolerance
