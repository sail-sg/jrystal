# Task 3: Align Energy Correction Calculation (QE PP)

## Status: PENDING - AWAITING HUMAN MANAGER INPUT

### Placeholder for Human Manager
This task description needs to be created/modified by the human manager before proceeding.

### Expected Content
- Objective: Align energy correction calculation between GPAW and jrystal using QE PP file
- Target: M_p Coulomb correction matrix calculations
- Success Criteria: Difference < 1e-4 between implementations
- Files to work with: [TO BE SPECIFIED]
- Constraints: [TO BE SPECIFIED]

### Notes
- Previous tasks have established PP file tests
- QE PP conventions documented in archived/paw_pp_file_documentation.md
- Cutoff radii: QE uses Rcut_US (1.2 Bohr for 2S, 1.4 Bohr for 2P)
