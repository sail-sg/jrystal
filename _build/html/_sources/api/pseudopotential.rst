pseudopotential
==============

.. warning::
   The pseudopotential module is currently under development and may
   undergo great changes in future versions. At this time, we only support the `UPF <https://pseudopotentials.quantum-espresso.org/home/unified-pseudopotential-format>`_ format. Additionally, our implementation is currently limited to norm-conserving pseudopotentials. Please note that many functions in this module are not yet fully differentiable.
   
.. note::
   The *ultrasoft* pseudopotential is under development and will be available in future versions.
