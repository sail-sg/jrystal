"""The pseudopotential module.

.. warning::
The pseudopotential module is currently under development and may
undergo changes in future versions. At this time, we only support the UPF
format. Additionally, our implementation is limited to
norm-conserving pseudopotentials. Please note that many functions in this module
are not yet fully differentiable.
