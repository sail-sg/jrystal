"""Grid operations for crystalline systems.

This module provides functions for working with real and reciprocal space grids in crystalline systems.
It includes utilities for:

- Generating G-vectors and R-vectors
- :math:`k`-point sampling for Brillouin zone integration
- Frequency space operations and masks
- Grid transformations between real and reciprocal space
