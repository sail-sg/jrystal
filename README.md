## Installation

You can install Jrystal directly from GitHub:

```sh
pip install git@github.com:sail-sg/jrystal.git
```

### Development Installation

To install in development mode:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sail-sg/jrystal.git
cd jrystal
pip install -e .
```

This allows you to modify the source code and have the changes take effect without rebuilding and reinstalling.

To build and serve the documentation locally:
```sh
make doc-dev
```
Then visit `localhost:8000`.

## Usage

Run calculations using the command line interface:

```sh
jrystal -m energy -c config.yaml
```

The following modes are supported:
- `energy`: compute the ground state energy of a system
- `band`: compute the band structure of a system

You can customize the calculation by modifying the `config.yaml` file.

## Band Structure Benchmarks

Jrystal has been benchmarked against Quantum ESPRESSO for various materials. Below are the comparison results for both all-electron and norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations.
