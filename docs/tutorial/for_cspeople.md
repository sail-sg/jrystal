# If You Are A Computer Scientist...

If you are a computer scientist, and don't have any experience in quantum mechanics, you may find this tutorial helpful.

(Sidemark: I choose to not talk about k-point by the simplest DFT formulation)

The DFT can be simply viewed as an constrained optimization problem.
$$
\min_{\psi_{i}, i \in [n]} E_{\text{total}}[\left\{ \psi_{i} \right\}]   \\
\int_{\Omega}\psi_i^*(\mathbf{r})\psi_j(\mathbf{r})d\mathbf{r} = \delta_{ij}, \quad \forall i, j \in [n],
$$
where $n$ is the number of the electron in the system. The constraints are that the orbital wave functions should be orthognormal
to each other and have unit norm which originates from typical quantum
mechanics conventions.

Let us take a close look at the objective function given as follows:

$$
  E_{\text{total}}[\left\{ \psi_{i} \right\}] = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i \in [n]} \int_{\Omega}\nabla \psi_i^*(\mathbf{r})\cdot \nabla \psi_i(\mathbf{r})d\mathbf{r} \\
  - \int_{\Omega}V_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r})\rho(\mathbf{r})d\mathbf{r}    \\
  + \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}V_{\text{har}}(\mathbf{r})\rho(\mathbf{r})d\mathbf{r}    \\
  \rho(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i \in [n]} \psi_i^*(\mathbf{r})\cdot \nabla \psi_i(\mathbf{r})
$$

It contains three parts: the kinetic energy (first term) depends on the wave functions of each orbitals and is the
summation of the kinetic energy of all the orbitals without any interaction;
the external energy measures the interaction between the electrons and the
nuclei, as the nuclei's positions are fixed in the cell, one can think of
this energy as the potential energy of the electron density in the electrostatic potential formed by the nuclei and thus is a linear functional of the electron
density that has negative sign; the Hartree energy is the energy of the
electron density in the electronic field generated by itself, the Hartree potential,
i.e. the electrostatic potential generated by the electron density obeys the
Coulomb law and can be solved via finite difference, finite element, or
Green's function.
\textbf{shall we discuss
that the DFT does not deal with the self-interaction of a single electron?}

As the kinetic energy depends on the wave functions of the orbitals instead of the electron density, the DFT is not exactly "density" functional. The computational procedure still requires the information of the wave functions.
